# An Introduction to R and R Studio!
R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and visualizations (i.e. making graphs). R is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software, but has also become the workshorse for scientists across disciplines for its flexibility, speed, and cost (open source). R is written primarily in C, Fortran and R itself and is freely available under the GNU General Public License.

You can download R here:
[The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org)

R is already installed on your Macbook Pro computers, and you can open an R environment easily in the terminal by simply typing the command:
```
R
```

However, for this introduction we are going to use a tool called ___R Studio___ as our R environment. ___R Studio___ should already be installed on your computers as well.  You can open ___R Studio___ by searching for it on your computers (click on the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner and type "R Studio" and hit \<ENTER\>).

If ___R Studio___ is not available, you can download it at this link: [R Studio](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.2.1335.dmg)

Once open, ___R Studio___ should look something like this:

___R Studio___ combines a graphical user interface with R's terminal-like interface called the "console".  
Let's start by writing a new R script:
1.  Click on the "+" icon in the upper left
2.  Select "R script"
